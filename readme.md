# PacketPirate üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

PacketPirate is a network packet capture and analysis tool built with Go and JavaScript. It provides a web-based interface for real-time packet inspection and filtering.

## What PacketPirate Does

PacketPirate allows users to:

1. Capture network packets in real-time from selected network interfaces.
2. Filter packets based on various criteria:
3. View detailed information about captured packets, including:
   - Source and destination MAC addresses
   - Source and destination IP addresses
   - Protocol information
   - Packet payload
4. Start and stop packet capture sessions dynamically through the web interface.

The tool uses Go for backend packet capturing and processing, leveraging the `gopacket` library for low-level packet handling. The frontend is built with JavaScript, providing an interactive user interface for controlling the capture process and viewing packet data.

PacketPirate caters to individuals seeking a straightforward, customizable network analysis tool that can be easily adapted to meet specific requirements.

*Note*: Running PacketPirate may require administrative privileges due to its need to access network interfaces at a low level.
